As I started my second year in university, I moved into a new apartment with 2 of my friends. One of those friends is hispanic (specifically Mexican, Colombian and Panamanian). I thought that this would be a good oppurtunity to finally learn spanish as I would have someone to practice it on, and maybe it would help me enjoy my favorite sport football (not soccer) even more.

So I asked him to only talk to me in Spanish and vice-versa as I thought that if I got familiar with the language, I would be able to pick up some words and grammatical concepts (turned out to be a really bad idea). Turns out that just cause you have spent 3 weeks on duolingo learning to say basic sentences is not enough to talk to someone who has spoken spanish their entire life. So I scrapped this talking-in-spanish method and I started the learning the language ([THIS VIDEO IS AN ABSOLUTE GODSEND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHDZSHCt1DE)). After watching the video for a few weeks and practicing with random people on [ome.tv](https://ome.tv), I am able to make basic and even some pretty complicated sentences in the present tense. But that is where my problem starts, spanish has so many more tenses than English, and each verb has its own conjugation for each tense, and then there are irregular verbs that have their own conjugations. I am slowly learning tenses, but its kinda hard to retain that information in my head.

Listening to spanish music has helped. I started listening to spanish music ([my playlist](https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/espa%C3%B1ol/pl.u-jV89b1WuD5bARL7)). It helps me understand how words are actually pronounced, and learn new ones. It's been a pretty fun journey, and its going to get even more and more difficult as I go on, but my target is to be conversationally fluent in Spanish before 2025 ends.
