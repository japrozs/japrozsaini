Recently, I've been doing too much web dev and app dev, and it's gone too my head and I need a break from interpreted languages and need to come back home, where I feel comfortable â€“ compiled languages. So, it's time to get back to C and C++.

Coincidentally, around this time, our [Rocket Club at GSU](https://rocket-tech-gsu.github.io/) started to get more and more ready and we started working on our [Level-1 High-powered rocket](https://www.nar.org/high-power-rocketry-info/level-1-hpr-certification-procedures/). And as all new projects start, we `mkdir`d a new directory, pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-tech-gsu) and let the coding begin.

We're going to be writing our own flight software in scratch in the Arduino library that is going to handle everything from the launch, to the avionics, the parachute system and the most important of them all, the landing sequence. This is going to be done with the help of a ton of engineers from GSU who are going to be working day and night to make this dream a reality and "build cool shit" along the way. We are going to be contributing to the repositories everything publicly and every single peice of source code that comes out of the organisation is going to be open-source. Lastly, this post is looking somewhat bland due to the absense of images, so here's a picture of the night-sky that I took from my phone.
