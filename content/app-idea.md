title: App idea â€“Â BeReal + Instagram templates
description: What if there was an app that was a mix between BeReal and Instagram templates

I was recently talking to some of my college friends when I noticed that they would get a notification from [BeReal](https://bereal.com/) and would instantly jump on their phones and start clicking quirky pictures to post on their account. This reminded of the new instagram feature where there are templates like "post a random picture of yourself" or "post a pic of your pet" etc. and it surprisingly received a lot of engagement and led me to an app idea (its a trash idea, but what if it works?).

## The Idea

I have never used BeReal before so I asked my friend if I could go through their account and see how the app works. I was of the impression that the hype for BeReal was over, but boi was i wrong! People were still pretty active on BeReal and they had a feature similar to [SnapStreaks](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/sections/5686234719636-Snapstreaks). I thought about building an app that was a closed community of students in a college campus (like [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/en-US/)) and everyday would come with a new prompt tailored to the students of that university and people would have to post a picture of that to the feed that everyone on the campus (except the professors ðŸ˜‰) can see and it would be a closed social media network (like [Facebook](https://facebook.com) originally was).



I'm 90% sure that this is a bad idea, but that other 10% just seems to keep nagging me. I don't have any other project ideas at the moment so I'm gonna be spending my time building this app. I'm gonna be using the same "goliath tech stack" that I generally use:

-   [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for the react native app
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [`postgres`](https://www.postgresql.org/) for server side
-   [`redis`](https://redis.com/) for caching and storing sessions
-   [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) probably for hosting

## Update

I've already starting building some of the app and I've got some screenshots to share. **please do not judge/read the text because i use random/weird text when testing and designing components**

I will probably finish the app in about 2 weeks, then upload it to the app stores (i've been wanting to join the apple dev program for so long). Then, I gotta rope in some of my marketing major friends and get them to start using the app and get their friends and their friends to join it too. And a few years down the road, boom! billion dollar company ðŸš€.

If it works, it works. If it doesn't, onto the next idea.
